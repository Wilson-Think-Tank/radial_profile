# Radio Profile Utilities

Generate ellipses/annuli to create radial profile plots of radio or other wavelength data.
Includes support for high-inclination galaxies.

There may be bugs or other unexpected behaviour, in which case just ping me on Slack or
send an email to [isaac.cheng.ca@gmail.com](mailto:isaac.cheng.ca@gmail.com). Also let me
know if there are typos in any documentation.

## Requirements

The following packages are required:

1. `astropy`
2. `matplotlib`
3. `numpy`
4. `photutils`
5. `radio_beam`
6. `copy` (a Python standard library)

## Quick Start

1. Download the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wilson-Think-Tank/radial_profile.git
   ```

2. Look at [`radial_profile_example.ipynb`](radial_profile_example.ipynb)

3. Profit?

As always, feel free to reach out if you need any help or clarification using this
package. In particular, the documentation for how we treat high-inclination galaxies is
unbelievably word-vomity, but I should be able to resolve any confusion if you just ping
me or send me an email. I can also do Zoom calls for a small fee of $3.14*!
