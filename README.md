# Radio Profile Utilities

Generate ellipses/annuli to create radial profile plots of radio or other wavelength data.
Does not yet support high-inclination galaxies (feature coming soon!).

There may be bugs or other unexpected behaviour, in which case just ping me on Slack or
send an email to [isaac.cheng.ca@gmail.com.](mailto:isaac.cheng.ca@gmail.com). Also let me
know if there are typos in any documentation.

## Requirements

The following packages are required:

1. `astropy`
2. `matplotlib`
3. `numpy`
4. `photutils`
5. `radio_beam`
6. `copy` (a Python standard library)

## Quick Start

1. Download the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wilson-Think-Tank/radial_profile.git
   ```

2. Look at [`radial_profile_example.ipynb`](radial_profile_example.ipynb)

3. Profit?

As always, feel free to reach out if you need any help or clarification using this
package.
